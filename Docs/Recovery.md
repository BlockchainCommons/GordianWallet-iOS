# Recovery

When creating a multi-signature wallet the user will be presented with a *Recovery QR*. It represents the devices seed and can be used to fully recover the wallet on your device in the scenario where you lost your device, deleted the wallet, or deleted the app.

Users will alos be presented with a 12 word *Recovery Phrase* which is a BIP39 mnemonic. In the multisig wallet this mnemonic represents your offline seed which is to be used to recover your wallet in the scenario where the user has lost there node for whatever reason.

The user may at any time export and save the *Recovery QR* code for any type of wallet, however once the user taps the "I saved them" button during the multi-sig wallet creation flow the 12 word BIP39 mnemonic will be gone forever and is in no way shape or form stored on the users device or node.

For all wallet types the user may at anytime go to the "Seed Info" view controller and see all the relevant informaion for their device's seed; including the RecoveryQR, 12 word BIP39 mnemonic, private and public  key descriptors.

## Scenarios to consider

### Multi-Signature Wallets

- 1. User loses their node or somehow deletes the wallet from their node.

        - The user will need to connect to a node, then scan the Recovery QR and input their 12 word offline recovery phrase and tap "Recover now".

- 2. User loses their device.

        - The user connects to their node and scans the Recovery QR to restore the wallet on their device.

- 3. User loses both device and node.

        - The user will need to connect to a node, then scan the Recovery QR and input their 12 word offline recovery phrase.

### Single-Signature Wallets

- 1. User loses their node or device or both.

    - The user will connect a new node and then scan or upload a *Recovery QR* at which point the node will automatically rescan for balances, the user may also input their recovery words if they lost the QR, the only difference will be that the user will need to choose a derivation scheme.


## *Recovery QR*

The *Recovery QR* is accesible to the user at anytime by tapping the info button next to the devices seed cell on the Wallets view controller, the user will be prompted to "Sign in with Apple" at this point for 2FA (two-factor authentication) purposes before any of the seed info will be displayed.

A *Recovery QR* is a simple json dictionary which consists of four mandatory values: `entropy`, `descriptor`,  `birthdate` and `blockheight`.

- Single-Signature RecoveryQR example:

```
{

    entropy:"ed3032b2f69ad7037d0a1ab388d91065", descriptor:"wpkh([fb41f110/84'/1'/0']tprv8fS7KWqL7UPBPtb8Q5dPKf7BtSyVYb1pGAs23znVpETNkAbEQvx59JNLWhWHBZRuJfkFszUwEjk1rDS6dUz2SFXxGMDMytw1TqSfA5tDBDD/0/*)#fjskw8",
    birthdate:1582800776,
    blockheight:61904
    label:"FullyNoded2 - SingleSig"

}
```

- Multi-Signature RecoveryQR example:

```
{

   entropy:"ed3032b2f69ad7037d0a1ab388d91065", descriptor:"wsh(multi(2,[cc2b88d9/84'/1'/0']tpubDDhKDzr8EeYqLP27xchAptrpUEqWecPGEXnjq3d1pKjzbHd6r7DKRPtBMxtQtjoCCqckVBoX6cfiGkBiJffGJYV3dMtabCp9bro29riQtKL/0/*,[ff7a130e/84'/1'/0']tprv8gEZHzJzKfefuNEzWstVsdzmE86SiMK8i8cZUMNDNVTcEWGZJknhKGYNJvRBoXG3R83BGPnrEWrCH2ogKEFUyUZXP8BgL1taExx2P884qUT/0/*,[8f7dba7b/84'/1'/0']tpubDDauNnbmWAmFaxbUDeYsHfsqgF5EK33eLpbw7W5eJz4V3sJ53tnTD2BjYEzJAX7DDscbZMg877vi9o5dyunG52FNDCqjnu126wKHxujMmzp/0/*))#ifjf8",

}
```

- `entropy` (string - required)

The hexadecimal string representation of the binary entropy used to derive your BIP39 mnemonic. We include this in the RecoveryQR so that we do not lose the 12 word mnemonic phrase when recovering wallets. The devices seed may be derived from this entropy. The multi-sig RecoveryQR will never be capable of signing for more then 1 of the 2 required signatures.

- `descriptor` (string - required)

Represents the wallets xprv, derivation path, address format and also the extended public keys associated with a multi-sig wallet. For more info about descriptors see this [link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md). FullyNoded 2 utilizes descriptors frequently throughout the app, therefore it is efficient programmatically to simply include them in the Recovery QR rather then seperate fields for derivation paths, address format, multi-sig public keys etc. The provided checksum is always the checksum for the public key descriptor, during the wallet recovery process we manipulate the descriptor by converting it back to a public key descriptor and save it for fetching addresses. We save the public key checksum as it is more efficient programmatically and results in less bitcoin-cli commands. The order of the extended keys is significant. The first key represents the offline recovery seed, the second key represents the device's seed and the third key represents the node's seed.

We only include the primary descriptor in the *Recovery QR*, FullyNoded 2 is smart enough to parse the descriptor then create and import the change descriptor into the node during the recovery process as per the relevant BIP derivation scheme spec.

- `birthdate` (integer - required)

Represents the unix timestamp for the birthdate of the seed associated with the wallet. We include this value in the `bitcoin-cli` recovery options under the Seed Info view, that way if the user does recover on their own node the wallet will automatically rescan to show historical transactions/balances.

- `blockheight` (integer - required)

Represents the blockheight when the wallet was first created, this is used to rescan the blockchain after the wallet is successfully recovered. Because we use multiple `importmulti` commands when creating/recovering wallets we can not use the `birthdate` to rescan for each `importmulti` command.

- `label` (string - optional)

The label a user may add to a wallet to easily identify it. This feature will soon be added to FullyNoded 2 and is therefore included here for forward compatibility.
