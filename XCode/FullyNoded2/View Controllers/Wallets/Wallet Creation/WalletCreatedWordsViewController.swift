            On the next screen we will display 12 very important words.

            You *MUST* write these 12 words down and save them seperately from the Recovery QR, *THEY ARE REQUIRED* to recover a multi-signature wallet if you lose your node.
            
            They are also required to add more keys to your node, we imported 2,500 keys into your node, when you use your 2,400th key we will prompt you to refill the keypool with these words. If you lose these words you should immediately create a new multi-sig wallet and "sweep to" it.

            These words **WILL BE DELETED FOREVER** once you tap the "I saved them" button!

            At a minimum we recommend writing these words down on water proof paper with a permanent marker.

            You should write these 12 words down and save them seperately from the Recovery QR.
            
            The seed is also included in the Recovery QR so these words act as a redundant back up that can be used with other apps.
